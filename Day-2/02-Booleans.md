# Booleans
---
# Key concepts

- Boolean variables are declared with the type `bool`
- They can only hold two possible values `true` or `false`
- The zero value for a boolean variable (the default when no value is assigned) is `false`. For example, a declared varaible `var flag bool` is automatically initilized to `false`
- Variables can also be declared and assigned values immediately, e.g., `var isAwesome = true`.
